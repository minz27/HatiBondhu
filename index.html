              We are a non-profit organization working with local communities
              and elephants to mitigate human-elephant conflict and promote
              peaceful coexistence between the two in Assam. Our projects
              focus on 'bringing communities and elephants together' as we
              believe in finding sustainable solutions that encourage
              coexistence and address the needs of both local communities and
              wild elephants in the landscape.

            <p>
              In Assam, elephant habitats are increasingly encroached upon by humans and are left degraded and vulnerable to
              various industrial and agricultural activities. Today, the major environmental issue concerning the survival
              of such magnificent animals is the lack of food security in the region. <br/><br/>
              I, Pradip Kumar Bhuyan – an octogenarian and an environmentalist, alongside my team at Hati-Bondhu, are on a
              mission to ensure the survival of wild elephants by addressing the depleting food security experienced by
              elephants in the region. To address this concern, we are planting fast-growing grasses like Napier and Broom
              grass in elephant habitats and are also planting favourable fruit trees like bananas, jack-fruits, elephant
              apples to supplement long-term habitat improvement. We also, in collaboration with rural communities, have
              started paddy plantations for elephants – as paddy has been the major source of conflict between locals and
              elephants during the harvesting period (Nov-Jan) annually. All activities undertaken by our organization are
              fueled by our love for elephants and support from our local partners – the community. In our folklore,
              elephants are called Sarabjans – meaning the wisest and cleverest, and we believe that such a title is
              befitting for elephants as they are highly intelligent and sophisticated social animals. Through our
              interactions with elephants on the field, we have learned to understand them as they have learned to
              understand us.
              <br/><br/>
              Today, the relationship between elephants and humans are marked by violence, conflict, and intolerance. We
              have encroached upon their spaces, destroyed their habitats, and depleted their food sources. To mitigate
              conflict and prevent further depredation of the long-standing relationship between man and elephant – we need
              to change our attitudes towards elephants and nature. We must learn to empathize and sympathize with elephants
              and show our ability to co-exist through our actions. From my personal experiences, I confidently can say that
              if we can demonstrate compassion and tolerance towards our gentle giants, they will reciprocate in incredible
              ways. My hope for the future is that humans and elephants learn to co-exist and develop a symbiotic
              relationship that sustains our survival as well as theirs. I believe that ‘love is the essence of conflict
              resolution’ – especially between humans and elephants.

              "Hati Bondhu’s strategy to avoid Man-Elephant conflict is undoubtedly the most effective and successful programme I have seen in the country or even in Africa . Tireless efforts and motivation provided by one man …Pradip Bhuyan brought the communities together not only to put their shoulders in a joint community effort but they also offered their ancestral land to create the most amazing buffer of ” lure crops ” between their crops n the wild elephants. Enabling smooth harvesting… No loss of life has been reported since the begining of this unique project. The entire credit goes to Pradeep Bhuyan’s Hathi bandhu …the passion dedication of one man whose tireless commitment has resulted in saving human lives n property. …A viable solution that can be replicated in man animal conflict areas across the country . A viable solution and a win win for man and India’s elephants."

The villagers have shown all the same big love, compassion and trust for their elephants, and believed the guidance by Pradip Bhuyan Sarabjan sir and Roon Bhuyan, and by Dulu Bora & Meghna Hazarika who do the fantastic work in the field. God bless your all good spirits. May this project be an example for all the conflict areas inside the country of Assam and across borders, and reunite people who struggle about their crops with love and compassion for elephants and nature.

              "Till the day I went to stay at the Hati Bondhu Camp, I didn’t realize how unique and effective it is, what they have
              done! My friend Roon’s father, Mr Pradip Bhuyan, has been tirelessly working to find solutions for man – elephant
              conflicts at the age of 85, along with local wild life activists like Dulu Bora. And what they have achieved in 3
              years is no less than a miracle! There has been literally no conflict and loss of life in just, such a short period
              of, an idea and a project taking off! The villagers who would almost hate elephants for the loss of their crop and the
              mess they thought the elephants created are now, “Hati Bondhus”- friends of the elephants!
            
              As much as I read about stuff around the world this design is so unique and fruitful, that it should surely be adopted
              by all other places in India where there is man – elephant conflict. The villagers willingly give one crop to the
              elephants annually, and the elephants in return come down to their designated area only and leave after they eat their
              favorite paddy. They no more head towards the rest of the land or the village! And in just a short period of 3 years,
              the elephants acknowledged this gesture by the villagers! It’s no less than a miracle. I am so happy to be a part in
              motivating Hati Bondhu volunteers to do more and convince other areas to do the same, which they plan to now. Hope I
              can help, in any way. Roon Bhuyan and Dulu Bora to augment what Pradip Bhuyan uncle envisioned."

              "For me, Hathi Bondhu is not a program but a movement led by
              the Octogenarian, Activist, Social Worker, Environmentalist,
              Naturalist, Philanthropist……Shri Pradip Bhuyan. A movement where Dulu Bora, Roon Bhuyan, the Osom Educational
              Trust have played a key role and framed the rightly coined
              “Elephant Haven Habitation Project”. It is my fortune that I have
              been associated with the program since its inception more as a
              well wisher and a policy guide and seeing it grow from a humble
              program to a movement that has now attracted global attention.
            
              The Policy makers, the Forest Department of Assam, the MOEF& CC are all aware of the Program in such a short span of
              time. I wish this program becomes a flagship movement in the history of Elephant conservation in India where,
              tradition, culture, ecology, music, wildlife science all merge into a coalition of efforts to save these magnificent
              and gentle giants…symbolically the Lord Ganesha."
