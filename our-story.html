            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>
              The humble beginnings of Hati Bondhu (Friends of Elephants), Assam - date back to an
octogenarian’s hope to protect wild elephants and their depleting habitats in rural Assam.
To achieve this, a brochure titled the "Elephant Heaven Habitat Project (EHHP) Vol. 1 of 2018"
was published with an extensive list of aims and objectives highlighting the need for more
comprehensive action. With months of fieldwork and observational study, the brochure
evolved into an assembled campaign initiated by the Osom Educational Trust (OET),
established in 1986 - to protect wild elephants from the threat of diminishing forest cover
and electrocution caused by ill-maintained and high-voltage sagging electric lines in 2018.

            <p>
              One of the earliest projects of the Hati Bondhu campaign was to use bamboo poles to
support sagging power lines in locations where the problem had remained undetected and
unresolved. This was the elephant project's first conservation challenge in 2018. With a goal
to facilitate safe passage for wild elephants in these areas, local communities were engaged
to assist and tackle the matter after several failed attempts to negotiate and hold relevant
authorities accountable. As its first major intervention, Hati Bondhu successfully raised 288
sagging electric lines in remote parts of Nagaon and surrounding villages along the slopes of
Karbi Anglong, Assam - all with the help of local volunteers and community leaders. The
effort was a success as it played a key role in reducing elephant deaths caused by
electrocution in various troubled locations while also highlighting the issue of Human-
Elephant Conflict (HEC) in the area.

          <div class="col-lg-6 order-2 order-lg-2 pt-3 pt-lg-0">
            <p>Following the project's initial success, a habitat restoration initiative using community
              plantations was launched in desolate areas to supplement the nutritional needs of
              elephants locally. On several occasions, elephants would stray towards neighboring villages
              in search of food due to depleting habitats and increased human encroachment, thereby
              resulting in hostility between communities and herds. To reduce negative interactions
              between the two groups and reinforce more positive sentiments towards elephants, local
              communities that were previously affected by human-elephant conflict were engaged in
              the allocated plantation areas and were actively part of the entire planning and
              implementation process. The project&#39;s operation and outcomes were successful as the
              community displayed cooperation, support, and dynamic participation in the habitat
              restoration program in both 2018 and 2019.

          <div class="col-lg-6 order-3 order-lg-3 pt-3 pt-lg-0">
            <p>As the project proceeded with its operations, it became evident that effective conservation
              could not be accomplished without significant community involvement. People’s attitudes
              towards elephants needed to change in order to reduce hostility between both groups. As a
              result, Hati-Bondhu (Friends of Elephants), Assam organized itself into a collaborative non-
              profit organization of local communities and conservationists working together to promote
              the welfare of Asian elephants using holistic community-based interventions that
              encourage co-existence between locals and wild elephants in the region.</p>
