            <h3>Community Plantation in Golaghat, Assam</h3>
            <p>
              Golaghat has always been an active human-elephant conflict zone in
              Assam. Increasing human populations, demands for cultivable lands and
              conversion of forest habitat to human habitation and cropland, has resulted
              in serious conflicts between locals and elephants in the area. Marked by
              ruthless violence, aggression, injuries, and high cases of human and
              elephant deaths annually - Golaghat is in urgent need of human-elephant
              conflict management.
              To address this, we are expanding our mitigation operations in the area and
              have identified strategic locations to initiate mass plantation of Napier
              grass (Pennisetum purpureum) - thereby creating natural buffers for
              elephants that stray towards local villages in search for food. Our
              operations will commence during the peak human-elephant conflict period,
              which is between Nov - Jan (2021-2022) , with full support from local
              volunteers, and stakeholders.

            <h3>Habitat Enrichment Program in Hatikuli, Assam</h3>
            <p>
              According to our field survey, Hatikuli, which falls
              under two districts - Golaghat and Karbi Anglong, is
              marked as an important and frequent migratory route
              for wild elephants. However, expansion of agricultural
              and industrial activities have left forest areas in Hatikuli
              barren and depleted. To address this issue, we initiated
              a Napier (Pennisetum purpureum) and Tiger Broom
              grass(Thysanolaena) plantation program in Hatikuli -
              which has been ongoing since May 2020. Both Napier
              and Tiger broom grass are endemic to the area and are
              characterised as fast-growing grass species with high
              regenerative capacity. For this program, we planted
              100,000 saplings of Napier and Tiger Broom grass
              (each) on approximately 70 acres of barren land in
              Hatikuli.
              Based on our field observations and report, plantation
              of such fast-growing - yet favourable grass species -
              was a significant step forward towards supplementing
              food security and enriching the quality of elephant
              habitat in the area. Due to the program's positive
              outcome in Hatikuli, we intend to extend our habitat
              enrichment model to other suitable and neighbouring
              locations by 2021.

            <h3>Community Paddy plantation in Ronghong Village, Assam</h3>
            <p>Farming communities in Ronghong village located on the foothills of Karbi Anglong
              experience high levels of crop raids and property damage by elephants annually- thereby
              causing frequent conflicts between local farmers and wild elephants in search of food.
              Both locals from the area and elephants have suffered fatal injuries and in some cases -
              death, due to rising tensions between the two.
              As a part of our initiative to mitigate human-elephant conflict, we started a paddy
              plantation on 68 acres of community-owned land for elephants in Ronghong Village in
              2018. After twenty sessions of stakeholder meeting and focus group discussions, Hati
              Bondhu was able to convince farmers from Ronghong village to work towards the cause
              of elephant welfare and gained their support for the paddy plantation program.
              The project outcome revealed that the intervention was effective as herds of
              approximately 350 elephants feasted on the paddy plantations and remained confined in
              the plantation site for three days during the - typically tense harvesting season. This
              outcome enabled farmers from Ronghong Village, and neighbouring villages to harvest
              their paddy crops without any external disturbances. Our field study and observations
              revealed that 10,000 acres of community agricultural fields benefitted from this
              intervention. Due to our program success, we have continued our program operations in
              Ronghong village and are expanding our paddy plantation activities in the fringe areas of
              Karbi Anglong, with help from our local partners</p>

            <h3>Skill development and Training workshops in Chapanala, Assam</h3>
            <p>
              Our ongoing skill development and training workshops focus on developing vocational
skills and improving livelihood opportunities for rural communities living in fringe areas.
Often, due to lack of good employment opportunities, exposure, training, and consistent
income - communities living in remote forest areas resort to illegal activities such as
logging, poaching, and stone quarrying. These illegal activities impede conservation efforts
and cause a major threat to the sustenance of natural habitats and local wildlife. Moreover,
many rural communities experience substantial economic losses due to crop and property
damage caused by elephants. Such losses fuel aggression and violence towards elephants
locally. 
To address this, we have - and continue to - organise workshops in the fringe areas of
Chapanala, located in Assam's Nagaon district, to empower isolated and low-income
communities through vocational skill development and training workshops three days a
week. Hati-Bondhu provides agriculture-based training with government-supported
schemes and facilities to help create better economic opportunities for those who require it
and are economically affected by human-elephant conflict. Our community skill
development and training program is ongoing and we aim to continue improving the
livelihood status of rural communities and help mitigate economic losses sustained from
human-elephant conflict.

            <h3>Sensitisation and awareness program for rural school children in Chapanala,
              Assam.</h3>
            <p>As part of our mission to protect elephants in the wild, we have organised a series of
              activity-based workshops for rural school children focusing on environment and wildlife
              conservation in our Hati Bondhu base camp, located in Chapanala, Assam. The workshops
              allow us to inform young audiences of different age groups on the various environmental
              challenges that confront our society today. Our sensitisation and awareness workshops are
              conducted in the Hati Bondhu training centre, once a week. We engage learning tools such
              as games, plays, discussions, and presentations to stimulate students from different
              academic backgrounds.
              This year, we are expanding our program outreach by extending our scope of participation
              to senior students studying in neighbouring colleges and universities near Chapanala. The
              goal is to create dialogue amongst the youth living in rural areas on multiple environmental
              issues - especially human and elephant conflict. Our program also sponsors resource
              persons - such as local environment entrepreneurs, activists, conservationists, practitioners -
              to help facilitate workshops and impart their field knowledge and experiences.
