              <h3>The Elephant Habitat Enrichment Program</h3>
              <br/>
              <p>
                Due to depleting forest habitats and resources, we recognize the lack
                of food security as a pressing concern for elephants. To aid this
                problem, we have designed a program focusing mainly on identifying
                and mapping elephant migratory routes and subsequently improving
                the quality of those areas through the plantation of favourable grass
                species such as Tiger broom grass <i>(Thysanolaena)</i>, Tora <i>(Alpinia
                nigra)</i>, Napier <i>(Cenchrus purpureus)</i>, and fruit trees such as
                elephants apples <i>(Dillenia indica)</i>, and Jackfruit <i>(Artocarpus
                heterophyllus)</i> - to supplement the nutritional requirements of
                elephants. The logic behind this initiative is that by improving food
                security for wild elephants in their natural habitats, crop raiding
                behaviours in community crop fields will drastically be reduced.

              <h4>Hatikhuli and Nonoi, Assam</h4>
              <p>Hatikhuli, Assam is one of our primary and pioneering areas of
                operations where the habitat restoration program was first initiated.
                Hatikhuli, which falls under two districts - Golaghat and Karbi
                Anglong, is marked as an important and frequent migratory route for
                wild elephants. However, expansion of agricultural and industrial
                activities have left forest areas in Hatikhuli barren and depleted. To
                address this issue, we initiated a Napier grass <i>(Pennisetum
                purpureum)</i> and Tiger Broom grass <i>(Thysanolaena)</i> plantation
                program in Hatikhuli - which has been ongoing since May 2020. Both
                Napier and Tiger broom grass are endemic to the area and are
                characterized as fast-growing grass species with high regenerative
                capacity. For this program, we planted 100,000 saplings of Napier
                and Tiger Broom grass (each) on approximately 70 acres of barren
                
                land in Hatikhuli. Based on our field observations and report,
                plantation of such fast-growing - yet favourable grass species - was
                a significant step forward towards supplementing food security and
                enriching the quality of elephant habitat in the area.
                
                Due to the program's positive outcome in Hatikhuli, we extended our
                habitat enrichment model to <b>Nonoi, Assam</b> which has also been
                identified as another important elephant migratory route in need of
                habitat restoration and preservation.</p>

                training program</h3>
                <br/>
              <p>
                As mentioned earlier, one of our core beliefs is to help empower
                rural communities to manage humanelephant conflict and manage
                the subsequent losses that are associated with it. Our community
                skill development and training program mainly focuses on
                agriculture-based vocational training such as bee-keeping, animal
                husbandry, agroforestry practices etc. The purpose of this training
                program is to help enrich and elevate local skillsets and support
                local communities to enhance their livelihoods and businesses. By
                doing so, we empower communities affected by human-elephant
                conflict to manage their losses effectively and find additional
                livelihood opportunities that benefit them economically and
                socially.

            <div class="col-lg-6 order-2 order-lg-1 pt-3 pt-lg-0">
              <p>Our ongoing skill development and training workshops focus on
                developing vocational skills and improving livelihood opportunities
                for rural communities living in fringe areas. Often, due to lack of
                good employment opportunities, exposure, training, and consistent
                income - communities living in remote forest areas resort to illegal
                activities such as logging, poaching, and stone quarrying. These
                illegal activities impede conservation efforts and cause a major
                threat to the sustenance of natural habitats and local wildlife.
                Moreover, many rural and marginalized communities experience
                substantial economic losses due to crop and property damage
                caused by elephants. Such losses often fuel aggression and
                violence towards elephants. To address this, we have - and
                continue to - organize workshops in the fringe areas of Chapanala,
                located in Assam&#39;s Nagaon district, to empower isolated and low-
                income communities through vocational skill development and
                training workshops three days a week. Hati-Bondhu provides
                agriculture-based training with government-supported schemes
                and facilities to help create better economic opportunities for those
                who require it and are economically affected by human-elephant
                conflict. Our community skill development and training program is
                ongoing and we aim to continue improving the livelihood status of
                rural communities and help mitigate economic losses sustained
                from human-elephant conflict.</p>

              <h3>Community Paddy Plantation
                Program</h3>
                <br/>
              <p>
                This is a collaborative program with
                local communities to initiate paddy
                plantation for elephants on community
                land - thereby creating a ‘Food buffer
                Zone’ to keep elephant herds
                strategically contained in a demarcated
                area for a short period and away from
                primary crop fields during the
                harvesting season.
                This program is currently ongoing and
                is operational in a remote village area
                called - Ronghong Village, situated in
                Assam’s Nagaon district. Sixty-five
                acres of community land is selected
                annually to plant paddy crops for
                migrating elephants to forage, thus
                preventing them from straying towards
                community fields in search of food.
                This has been one of our most
                successful projects and has helped
                inform our study on elephant
                behaviours.

              <h4>Paddy plantation in Ronghong village and Golaghat, Assam</h4>
              <p>
                Farming communities in Ronghong village located on the foothills of
Karbi Anglong experience high levels of crop raids and property
damage by elephants annually- thereby causing frequent conflicts
between local farmers and wild elephants in search of food. Both
locals from the area and elephants have suffered fatal injuries and in
some cases - death, due to rising tensions between the two. As a
part of our initiative to mitigate human-elephant conflict, we started
a paddy plantation on 68 acres of community-owned land for
elephants in Ronghong Village in 2018. After twenty sessions of
stakeholder meeting and focus group discussions, Hati Bondhu was
able to convince farmers from Ronghong village to work towards the
cause of elephant welfare and gained their support for the paddy
plantation program.
                <br />
                The project outcome revealed that the intervention was effective as
herds of approximately 350 elephants feasted on the paddy
plantations and remained confined in the plantation site for three
days during the - typically tense harvesting season. This outcome
enabled farmers from Ronghong village, and neighbouring villages to
harvest their paddy crops without any external disturbances. Our
field study and observations revealed that 10,000 acres of
community agricultural fields benefitted from this intervention. Due
to our program success, we have continued our program operations
in Ronghong village and are expanding our paddy plantation
activities in the fringe areas of Karbi Anglong, with help from our
local partners. Currently, our paddy plantation program is also
operational in Golaghat which is in urgent need of human-elephant
conflict management. we are expanding our mitigation operations in
the area and have identified strategic locations to initiate mass
plantation of Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) - thereby
creating natural buffers for elephants that stray towards local
villages in search for food.

              <p>As part of our mission to protect elephants in the wild, we have organised
                a series of activity-based workshops for rural school children focusing on
                environment and wildlife conservation in our Hati Bondhu base camp,
                located in Chapanala, Assam. The workshops allow us to inform young
                audiences of different age groups on the various environmental
                challenges that confront our society today. Our sensitisation and
                awareness workshops are conducted in the Hati Bondhu training centre,
                once a week. We engage learning tools such as games, plays, discussions,
                and presentations to stimulate students from different academic
                backgrounds. We are currently expanding our program outreach from
                2021 by extending our scope of participation to senior students studying
                in neighboring colleges and universities near Chapanala. The goal is to
                create dialogue among the youth living in rural areas on multiple
                environmental issues - especially human and elephant conflict. Our
                program also sponsors resource persons - such as local environment
                entrepreneurs, activists, conservationists, practitioners - to help facilitate
                workshops and impart their field knowledge and experiences.</p>
